# Gait Recognition with Wii Balance Board
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **gait recognition system** using the **Wii Balance Board**. The system collects balance and pressure data while a person is walking and uses it to identify individuals based on their unique walking patterns. Gait recognition has a wide range of applications in areas such as security, surveillance, rehabilitation, and healthcare monitoring.

## System Requirements

- Wii Balance Board
- Python 3.x
- BrainBLOX software
- Windows XP,7,8,10 and later
